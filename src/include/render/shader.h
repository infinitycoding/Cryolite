 * Contains the shader-class and a few types used by it.                    *
 * With the shader-class you can load, compile and link shaders.            *

 * Useage: Write a vertex-shader and a fragment-shader.                     *
 * Put them in files. Create an instance of the shader-class.               *
 * Now load, compile and the to shader-files with the                       *
 * standart-constructor or with loadShader() and make().                    *
 * Activate the shader with activate(), deactivate it with deactivate().    *
